nav service: create a method that get a string (skills) and return uts ID
another method that get current and next string and return 'left' or 'right" = the navigation direction
test it
in the nav
1. Import ActivatedRoute and ParamMap to your component.
2. Inject an instance of ActivatedRoute by adding it to your application's constructor:
3. Update the ngOnInit() method to access the ActivatedRoute and track the id parameter:
ngOnInit() {
  this.route.queryParams.subscribe(params => {
    this.name = params['name'];
  });
}
A router outlet emits an activate event when a new component is instantiated, and a deactivate event when a component is destroyed.
<router-outlet
  (activate)='onActivate($event)'
  (deactivate)='onDeactivate($event)'></router-outlet>

//while clicking on a link
1. extreact the link id
2. extract the current ID
3. use the nav servbice to decide the direction
4. transfer this info dynamicaly to the router module
